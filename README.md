I am very happy to have the opportunity that you have offered me. This repository contains the requested project ready. Below some information:
* Written in Kotlin;
* Based on the MVVM architecture;
* I used Retrofit to communicate with the API, with GSON to convert JSON into objects;
* I downloaded the images with Picasso;
* I used Koin for dependency injection
